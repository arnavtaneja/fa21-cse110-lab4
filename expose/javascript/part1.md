1. values added: 20
2. final result: 0
3. values added: 20
4. there will be an error as there is no result that is defined in the scope of the log statement
5. There will be an error as a const is being redefined
6. There will be an error as a const is being redefined

Part 2

1. 3 will print as that is what the value of i is at the last iteration of the for loop
2. 150 will print because discounted price was defined last in line 7 in the third iteration of the for loop
3.  150 will print as final price was defined on line 8 in the last iteration of the for loop
4. [50,200, 300 ], Every value in the prices array will be multiplied by the discount and then pushed to the discounted array
5. There will be an error because there is no 'i' defined in the scope of the log statement
6. There will be an error because there is no 'discountedPrice' defined in the scope of the log statement
7. 150 will print as that was the last element in the prices array that was processed
8. [50,100,150] will be returned. There is no issues with scopes and things so everything should print fine.
9. There will be an error as the scope of the 'i' is in the for loop and thus can not be accessed on line 11
10, 3 will be printed out as the the value of length is set and then never changed
11. [50,100,150] will be returned. The function will operate like normal as there is no errors to to prevent it from being solved.
